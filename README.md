# TeamSpeak 3 patcher
Welcome to the official TeamSpeak 3 patcher github repository

## What is this?
TeamSpeak 3 patcher is a TeamSpeak 3 plugin which allows you to disable the TeamSpeak 3 blacklist and allows you to join 3.1 TeaSpeak servers!

## How can i test it?
Well i don't know if everybody of you knows a grey/blacklisted server, or a patcher 3.1 server so I provide a small test server:

Blacklist patch test: `ts.teaspeak.de:9987` (This server should be blacklisted)  
**Attention**:  
This plugins does not clear the cache!  
Once TeamSpeak cached the blacklist status you have to wait some time until it tries to refresh it!  

License patch test: `ts.teaspeak.de:9988` (This server should have a fake 3.1 Annual Activation License (with 120 slots))  
**Attention**:  
This server isn't up at any time (its also my private test server! Later the main server will be used for this test)
